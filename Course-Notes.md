## Points drawn from "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinny Second Edition Chapter 1 Reading
1. Data visualization is the nothing but the graphical representation of data in order to display data and information in the form of graphic charts, bars and many other visualizations tools for detailed analysis.
2. Python plays a significant role in data visualization because of its interesting inbuilt libraries. Few mentioned below :
  - **NumPy** – Provides math functions (numerical computation)
  - **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Matplotlib** – a plotting library for data visualisation.
  - **SciPy** -  Scientific computing, optimization and statistics.
  - **Scikit-learn** - machine learning and data mining
3. Import Conventions - Python adopts a number of naming conventions for commonly used modules mention in examples : pd for pandas, np for numpy and plt for matplotlib.pyplot.
 - import pandas as pd # for data analysis and manipulation
 - import numpy as np  # for calucation 
 - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for visualisation
